      evidence_ref: "Canonical main source plus accepted audited-construction receipts"

      evidence_ref: "Texture delayed-research V1-without-V2 trace and Round 72 G1 rejection recorded in the superseded Definition"
    - claim: "Round 72 built and passed focused checks but remained undeployed and rejected because mutable agentcore could request updater authorization using caller-computed commitments without independent accepted-event proof."
      evidence_ref: refs/heads/selfdev/g1-round72-signed-activation@5517c2eb5c94678eb4ec323fef2cec34b96f7c6a
    - claim: "Texture has a broad same-origin API used by the desktop, while the public CLI is mostly read-only and current lifecycle projections can mistake run/passivation signals for document completion."
      evidence_ref: "frontend/src/lib/texture.js; internal/textureowner; cmd/choir; staged delayed-research trace"
    - claim: "Actor updates/snapshots and coagent/work state span overlapping SQLite and Dolt stores; run continuation and run acceptance remain transitional surfaces."

      evidence_ref: "2026-07-21 Node A/B checkout, systemd executable, health, ownership, and guest-health inventory"
  unknowns:
    - "Which existing store/reducer should own each durable subject/update/work transition after the writer/caller inventory; the invariant is one authority per object, not a preselected database."
    - "The narrowest public snapshot/event/command contract that can prove the lifecycle without freezing a universal Texture schema."

finish:
  deliver: "One stable staging Choir computer executes one honest durable-work lifecycle through a supported public typed product path. An artifact may advance through many revisions; an unresolved obligation survives activation completion and runtime restart; a later typed update wakes a reconstructible durable subject; native work authority alone settles or cancels; desktop and headless clients observe the same resumable state; authorized effects remain separately gated and OFF."
  artifact: "A deployed generic durable-work kernel and public lifecycle contract joining artifact head, durable subject/activation, obligations, typed update dispositions, settlement/cancellation, restart reconstruction, and exact executable identity without using RunID, provider transcript, UI state, or effect receipts as semantic authority."
  acceptance:
    - action: "From a clean client, retrieve a signed/bound no-SSH inventory joining canonical GitHub ref, Node B checkout cleanliness, NixOS closure, service executable paths and embedded commits, deployed commit, guest image/config digests, active ComputerID/realization/epoch, and guest builds."
      proves: "The exercised staging system is exactly identified; missing or conflicting identity refuses acceptance."
      evidence_class: deployed_no_ssh_identity_inventory
    - action: "Through the supported public protocol, create an initial artifact, allow a replaceable activation to revise zero or more times and open one real delayed evidence obligation, then finish/passivate that activation without terminalizing the work."
      proves: "Artifact revision and activation completion do not imply work settlement; no placeholder revision or predefined researcher stage is required."
      evidence_class: deployed_durable_work_lifecycle
    - action: "Restart the relevant runtime and reconstruct the same durable subject, artifact head, obligation, pending-update dispositions, cancellation state, and evidence refs without a RunID or provider transcript as authority."
      proves: "Continuity is durable product state rather than process ancestry or conversational memory."
      evidence_class: deployed_restart_reconstruction
    - action: "Deliver one typed evidence update exactly once; let a new activation incorporate or explicitly reject it in a later revision; settle only after every material obligation and update has a terminal disposition. Replay duplicate and late delivery."
      proves: "Delivery is non-lossy and deterministic and native work authority alone settles."
      evidence_class: deployed_delivery_and_settlement
    - action: "Exercise owner cancellation before the first revision, while waiting, and after update delivery; reconnect both desktop and `choir` clients from an earlier cursor."
      proves: "Cancellation wins, retained revisions/evidence remain inspectable, and both clients observe identical snapshots, events, refusals, and receipts."
      evidence_class: deployed_cancellation_and_protocol_conformance
    - action: "Run one trivial grounded request and one evidence-heavy request through the same operation kernel."
      proves: "The harness permits proportional adaptive depth: no forced workflow for the trivial task and no premature settlement while material evidence obligations remain."
      evidence_class: deployed_adaptive_depth_product_trace
  rollback: "Before deployment, discard the docs/runtime candidate and restore accepted main. After deployment, use the retained prior ComputerVersion/checkpoint/route realization and canonical rollback evidence. Never recover by importing host-local mutable state or the rejected Round 72 branch."

    - "Only architecture prose, a source candidate, local tests, model review, dashboard rendering, or deployment identity is green."

north_star:
  statement: "Choir is becoming a persistent sovereign agentic computer whose state and authority outlive any model session. Texture may become its versioned hypermedia lens and usually accumulate many more revisions as inference and search become cheaper, but this mission does not freeze that larger interface architecture."
  emergence_rule: "Let the generic kernel and deployed evidence determine later Texture, MCP, World Wire, self-development, and Choir-in-Choir shape. Keep the harness strict about authority, provenance, delivery, budget, cancellation, and settlement while permissive about model choice, search, delegation, reasoning route, and revision count. Not every task should be deep."

# Converge Choir on One Durable Agentic Computer

The immediate goal is one honest durable-work kernel, not universal Texture or immediate self-development. Artifacts may revise many times; intelligence may adapt route and depth; obligations survive model and process boundaries; typed evidence wakes reconstructible subjects; native work authority settles; effects remain independently authorized. That bounded product proof is the cleanest route toward deeper Texture, safe self-development, MCP, World Wire, and Choir-in-Choir.
