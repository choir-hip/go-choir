# Overnight Autoradio Platform Checklist v0

## Purpose

This paradoc is the source program for an overnight, thread-native `/goal`
mission. The product forcing function is Autoradio: a screenless Choir surface
that continuously performs source-grounded, relevant material and accepts voice
interruption as first-class artifact input.

The execution order is deliberately constrained:

1. Object graph.
2. News / Universal Wire.
3. Choir-in-Choir self-development.
4. Nucleus capsules.
5. Choir Base.
6. Autoradio and Pipecat audio.

Autoradio is the north-star benchmark, but the mission must not build a
parallel audio toy. It must pull durable object, source, News, self-development,
sandboxing, and file-provider substrate forward in the order above, then use a
thin Autoradio vertical slice to prove that the substrate is useful.

## Thread Operating Model

This mission should be run with Codex thread tools. The current Codex app
surface, as discovered and re-confirmed on 2026-06-26, exposes the needed
thread primitives via `codex_app` after tool discovery. The orchestration
thread is the human-visible conductor for the overnight run. It owns this
checklist, the ledger, worktree hygiene, dependency order, and final evidence
packet. It does not self-certify implementation work.

Thread roles:

- **Orchestration thread:** reads this paradoc, updates Parallax State, creates
  worker and verifier threads, receives callbacks, chooses the next move by
  expected variant decrease per budget, and performs final evidence synthesis.
- **Implementation worker threads:** receive one bounded work item with
  authority limits, mutation class, protected surfaces, admissible evidence,
  rollback path, and callback target. They may implement only their assigned
  slice and must report dirty paths, commits, tests, blockers, and residual
  risk back to orchestration.
- **Verifier threads:** start from a clear context, read the paradoc plus the
  assigned diff or artifact, run review/proof commands as needed, and report
  findings first with file/line references and verdict `accept`,
  `revise_before_continue`, `blocked`, or `supersede`.

Required thread primitives and current semantics:

- `list_projects` to choose the `go-choir` project before creating
  project-scoped threads.
- `create_thread` to start orchestration-owned implementation and verifier
  threads. Prefer project worktree threads for implementation work and local
  project threads for read-only verifier work when that preserves independence.
- `send_message_to_thread` for orchestration follow-ups to active worker or
  verifier threads. Worker/verifier assignment prompts must include the
  orchestration thread id or callback instructions if the worker is expected to
  report back through thread tools.
- `read_thread` and `list_threads` to reconnect verdicts, recover interrupted
  context, and audit thread status without depending on chat-visible callbacks.
- `handoff_thread` plus `get_handoff_status` to transfer an existing thread and
  its git state between its checkout and a Codex worktree on the current host
  when ownership or execution substrate must change. Handoff interrupts a
  running thread, so it is an ownership-transfer tool, not a routine callback
  path.
- `set_thread_title`, `set_thread_pinned`, and `set_thread_archived` for
  operator hygiene: name worker/verifier threads by work item id, pin live
  orchestration-critical threads, and archive settled or superseded threads only
  after their evidence is recorded.

Observed Codex app behavior on 2026-06-26:

- The active orchestration environment can discover the thread tools with
  targeted tool search. Available primitives include `list_projects`,
  `create_thread`, `read_thread`, `list_threads`, `send_message_to_thread`,
  `handoff_thread`, `get_handoff_status`, and thread title/pin/archive
  controls.
- Worktree `create_thread` may return a `pendingWorktreeId` before the actual
  thread id is visible. Treat the pending handle as a launch receipt, not a
  worker identity. Reconnect with `list_threads` by cwd, title/work-item text,
  or the pending handle, then record the resolved thread id, cwd, branch/HEAD,
  and title/pin state once materialized.
- A verifier may correctly return `blocked` if it runs before the worker thread
  or final report exists. If the worker later materializes, record the earlier
  verifier result as stale launch-order evidence and send a follow-up with the
  resolved worker id, cwd, commits, diff/test scope, and non-claims.
- Tool discovery is progressive. A broad thread-tool search exposed
  `list_projects`, `create_thread`, `read_thread`, `list_threads`,
  `send_message_to_thread`, `handoff_thread`, and title/pin/archive controls;
  a targeted handoff search exposed `get_handoff_status`. Future orchestration
  should search for the specific thread primitive before declaring it absent.

If these tools are not exposed in the executing environment, the orchestration
thread must record that as a capability blocker. It may still perform local
planning or a single-thread checkpoint, but it must not claim a thread-native
overnight settlement or treat same-context review as independent proof.

Thread messages must be durable enough to resume: every worker assignment names
the paradoc path, ledger path, work item id, target files or surfaces, current
claim, admissible evidence, callback target, and stop condition.

## Overnight Work Items

### O0 - Preserve The Current WIP Queue

Goal: make the existing salvageable work durable before broad construction.

Checklist:

- [x] Record current main SHA and clean/dirty status.
- [x] Inventory all Codex/Cascade worktrees.
- [x] Mark the email-freeze worktrees superseded by main.
- [x] Preserve object-service prototype work before any cleanup.
- [x] Preserve Qdrant pipeline prototype work before any cleanup.
- [x] Preserve source-entity migration design state.
- [x] Preserve Universal Wire diagnosis state.
- [x] Extract PPTX prototype learning and mark prototype code disposable unless
  revived by a later mission.
- [x] Record recovery handles for any stash, branch, commit, or thread.

Evidence: `git worktree list --porcelain`, `git status --short` per worktree,
branch/commit/stash refs, and a ledger entry naming intentional source,
durable docs/evidence, temporary proof output, generated artifacts, and
unrelated WIP.

### O1 - Object Graph Foundation

Goal: land the smallest real object graph substrate that can carry source,
web-capture, media, run-sheet, Qdrant, and Base objects.

Checklist:

- [x] Review the object-service prototype for fit with current main.
- [x] Decide whether to land as `internal/objectgraph`, narrower package, or
  design-only successor.
- [x] Preserve stable object identity and content hash semantics.
- [x] Preserve edge storage semantics.
- [x] Add or retain focused tests for memory and SQLite stores.
- [x] Add the next missing integration test before claiming durable persistence.
- [x] Define minimal object kinds needed by News and Autoradio:
  `choir.source_entity`, `choir.source_ref`, `choir.web_capture`,
  `choir.media_item`, `choir.audio_recording`, `choir.transcript`,
  `choir.autoradio_run_sheet`.
- [x] Open a verifier thread before merge or settlement.

Acceptance: branch-level object graph foundation merged or a precise blocker
with review evidence. Platform behavior settlement requires the normal
commit/push/CI/deploy/staging loop if runtime behavior changes.

### O2 - Qdrant Derived Index Pipeline

Goal: make Qdrant a rebuildable derived index over object graph data, not a
parallel source of truth.

Checklist:

- [x] Review the Qdrant prototype for alias-switch correctness.
- [x] Verify against a real local Qdrant instance. Nix Qdrant `1.18.1` ran on
  `localhost:6333`; uncached live build/switch/rollback test passed.
- [x] Replace sample objects with object-service-backed inputs or explicitly
  defer that edge.
- [x] Keep deterministic hash embedding only as a test embedder.
- [x] Define production embedder/provider boundary without hard-coding role or
  provider assumptions.
- [x] Record derived-index rebuild and rollback path.
- [x] Open a verifier thread focused on schema, alias switch, and source-of-truth
  boundaries.

Acceptance: Qdrant build/switch can be tested locally and is documented as
derived/rebuildable. No staging claim without deployed proof.

### O3 - Source Entity Migration

Goal: migrate source truth into durable graph objects so News, Texture, and
Autoradio cite the same substrate.

Checklist:

- [ ] Start with Problem Documentation First if implementation reveals a new
  behavior problem.
- [x] Get independent review of the existing design.
- [x] Define source entity identity, citation carry-forward, and unused-source
  handling.
- [x] Ensure source citation remains tri-state: cited, toolbar-only, unused.
- [x] Keep Texture canonical writes protected. O3 Phase 1 store boundary
  accepted: source graph writes happen inside the Texture revision transaction
  before guarded head advancement.
- [x] Add tests that fail on disappearing source entities. Phase 1 covers a
  missing source entity/version rollback before document head advancement;
  Phase 2 adds focused Texture tool producer tests proving source entity graph
  records are shadow-written while legacy revision reads continue to work;
  Phase 3 adds source_ref graph-edge tests and head-stability coverage for
  unresolved graph refs.
- [x] Verify that source refs are native objects, not prose links. Phase 1 adds
  `texture_source_refs` records behind objectgraph-compatible IDs; Phase 3
  makes the selected Texture tool path shadow-write pinned `choir.source_ref`
  records. Phase 4 exposes graph-backed `source_entity_objects` and
  `source_refs` wrapper arrays additively on Texture revision reads; Phase 5
  adapts frontend source-open derivation so graph wrappers feed the existing
  native `source_ref` rendering and `sourceEntityLaunchPayload` path when
  legacy `source_entities` is absent.
- [x] Open a verifier thread before any red/orange landing claim. Phase 1
  verifier thread `019f02b0-47a4-74b2-b78a-44d13bdd958d` returned `accept`;
  Phase 3 verifier thread `019f02d4-80e7-7c73-8085-bc1c52beebf2` returned
  `accept` for branch-level continuation; Phase 4 verifier thread
  `019f02ed-d05e-78f1-975c-1de2df51451b` returned `accept` after a
  revision-list batching repair; Phase 5 verifier thread
  `019f031a-9eb9-7301-9db8-62bbb84e727a` returned `accept` for frontend
  graph-wrapper source derivation.

Acceptance: source entity persistence and source refs survive the relevant
Texture/source-open and News paths with focused tests, plus staging proof if
behavior-changing code lands to the platform. Current branch evidence covers
Texture store/runtime/API/frontend helper slices only; browser/product proof and
the News path remain open.

### O4 - News / Universal Wire

Goal: make Universal Wire work as a News benchmark over durable source and
web-capture objects.

Checklist:

- [x] Implement or wire `choir.web_capture`. O4 Phase 1 adds a typed
  `choir.web_capture.v1` objectgraph metadata contract, validation,
  `Service.CreateWebCapture`, object body storage for extracted text, and
  focused objectgraph tests. O4 Phase 2 adds an accepted branch-level Universal
  Wire fallback projection for existing graph-backed `choir.web_capture`
  objects through `/api/universal-wire/stories`. O4 Phase 3 adds accepted
  branch-level additive source/open identity fields for graph-backed fallback
  cards. O4 Phase 4 adds accepted branch-level frontend/browser proof that
  graph-backed capture cards render source-open controls and route Source
  Viewer/Web Lens through the existing source policy. O4 Phase 5 adds accepted
  branch-level sourcecycled/web/source ingestion into durable `choir.web_capture`
  graph objects with provenance edges; native Texture `source_ref` citation
  carry-forward and staging product proof remain open.
- [x] Ingest sourcecycled/web/source items into graph objects. O4 Phase 5 writes
  eligible sourcecycled `sources.Item` rows into `choir.web_capture` objects,
  creates `choir.source_entity` endpoints and `captured_from` provenance edges,
  and wires `cmd/sourcecycled` to opt-in objectgraph DB paths. This is accepted
  branch-level local code/test proof only; platform/deploy objectgraph DB
  configuration and staging product proof remain open.
- [x] Build News/Wire feed from graph objects and source refs. O4 Phase 7 adds
  accepted and incorporated branch-level Universal Wire graph fallback
  enrichment that reads `captured_from` edges from `choir.web_capture` objects
  to graph `choir.source_entity` provenance objects and exposes those source
  entities as Wire manifest context. It does not claim native Texture body
  `source_ref` citations, publication/export, deployed source artifacts,
  staging, or full News benchmark acceptance.
- [x] Keep empty feed honest but diagnostic. O4 Phase 8 adds accepted and
  incorporated branch-level empty-only Universal Wire diagnostics plus UI
  rendering. Empty responses stay empty and may include safe substrate
  diagnostic states; non-empty Texture/graph responses omit diagnostics. This
  does not claim staging, provider/search, Qdrant, publication/export,
  run-acceptance, promotion/rollback, or native Texture `source_ref`
  behavior.
- [x] Add acceptance for authenticated `/api/universal-wire/stories`. O4 Phase 6
  adds accepted branch-level authenticated public-route API proof that
  sourcecycled writes graph-backed `choir.web_capture` objects to the
  runtime-derived objectgraph DB path and a runtime opened on the same store path
  reads them through `GET /api/universal-wire/stories`. This does not prove
  staging/deploy/runtime daemon configuration.
- [x] Add browser proof that the Universal Wire app renders real story cards.
  O4 Phase 4 proves a graph-backed capture story card through the public
  `/api/universal-wire/stories` route mock in the authenticated desktop shell,
  with Source Viewer default and explicit Web Lens source opening.
- [ ] Verify source/citation links open to real source artifacts or Source
  Viewer/reader artifacts. O4 Phase 4 proves frontend routing for graph-backed
  fallback cards. O4 Phase 9 adds accepted and incorporated branch-level API/UI
  proof that graph-backed capture source handles carry durable reader snapshots
  and open Source Viewer/reader artifact text by default while Web Lens remains
  an explicit live/original action. O4 Phase 10c repairs the local browser
  harness needed for native Texture source-ref proof. O4 Phase 10d adds accepted
  and incorporated branch-level browser proof that native Texture graph-wrapper
  `source_ref` opening distinguishes inline citation note text from graph object
  reader body text and opens Source Viewer reader artifact content by default.
  Deployed/live source artifact proof remains open.
- [ ] Open independent verifier thread before claiming News benchmark.

Acceptance: on `https://choir.news`, authenticated Universal Wire returns and
renders non-empty, cited, source-grounded stories from durable graph/source
objects. Evidence includes deployed commit identity.

### O5 - Choir-in-Choir Self-Development

Goal: use the News/Universal Wire work as the first real self-development
payload rather than a toy task.

Checklist:

- [ ] Start from product path, not Codex-only edits.
- [ ] Use prompt bar / Texture / super path to create or continue a mission.
- [ ] Produce a reviewable PR, AppChangePackage, or precise blocker.
- [ ] Attach worker/candidate evidence to the artifact context.
- [ ] Attach verifier contract and verdict.
- [ ] Keep owner promotion and rollback boundaries explicit.
- [ ] Do not claim `promotion-level` without AppChangePackage adoption evidence
  plus owner review and promote/rollback evidence.

Acceptance: Choir-in-Choir creates a reviewable platform candidate for the News
path, with evidence strong enough that a separate review thread can evaluate it
without rediscovering the whole problem.

### O6 - Nucleus Capsules

Goal: start the sandboxing substrate after the News/self-development path has
a concrete workload that benefits from better isolation.

Checklist:

- [ ] Land or draft `CapsuleRunner` interface.
- [ ] Add fake runner and persisted result model.
- [ ] Add Nucleus strict-agent backend only after the interface is proven.
- [ ] Keep durable super outside Nucleus.
- [ ] Keep candidate VMs distinct from capsules.
- [ ] Use capsules for scratch/verifier/worker execution, not direct active
  state mutation.
- [ ] Define rollback and audit receipts for capsule execution.

Acceptance: one bounded worker or verifier command can run through a capsule
path with durable result evidence, or the blocker is precise enough to become
the next mission.

### O7 - Choir Base

Goal: begin the Dropbox-like foundation as a local reconciliation kernel, not
a premature File Provider implementation.

Checklist:

- [ ] Implement or refine `internal/base` value model.
- [ ] Model remote/local/synced trees.
- [ ] Use stable item IDs, immutable blobs, and journal-shaped metadata.
- [ ] Add deterministic scenarios for local edit, remote edit, delete/edit,
  move/edit, and conflict.
- [ ] Preserve ContentItem compatibility.
- [ ] Defer macOS File Provider and Wails product claims until the kernel proves
  convergence/conflict behavior.

Acceptance: focused kernel tests prove deterministic convergence/conflict
semantics. No Dropbox-like product claim yet.

### O8 - Autoradio And Pipecat Vertical Slice

Goal: prove Autoradio as a thin vertical slice over the substrate, then add
Pipecat as the realtime audio session layer.

Checklist:

- [ ] Define Autoradio station, queue, beat, and run-sheet object shapes.
- [ ] Generate a run sheet from News/Wire story objects.
- [ ] Render or stub TTS narration with artifact refs.
- [ ] Interleave narration with existing audio/podcast/media items.
- [ ] Store playback state and source refs as durable artifacts.
- [ ] Ingest user speech as recording -> transcript -> artifact -> index.
- [ ] Integrate Pipecat for realtime audio session control.
- [ ] Support spoken interruption that updates the queue and leaves evidence.
- [ ] Keep visual/text representation equivalent to audio behavior.

Acceptance: user can start a station, hear source-grounded material, interrupt
by voice, and see durable artifacts for run sheet, sources, transcript, and
queue update. If Pipecat is not reached overnight, settlement must name the
remaining audio transport gap precisely.

## Parallax State

status: working

mission conjecture: If an orchestration thread uses this checklist to preserve
current WIP, land or hand off the object graph substrate, then advance News,
self-development, Nucleus, Base, and Autoradio in dependency order with worker
and verifier threads, then Choir will materially advance toward an Autoradio
product benchmark without losing evidence or conflating local proxies with
staging/product proof.

deeper goal (G): Make Autoradio the concrete product benchmark for Choir's
self-improving mainframe: source-grounded information, durable artifacts,
self-development, sandboxed work, file-like persistence, and realtime audio
should converge into one usable experience.

witness/spec (A/S): This paradoc, its ledger, thread callbacks, worker branches,
verifier verdicts, landed commits, CI/deploy/staging receipts, accepted blockers,
and successor paradocs.

invariants / qualities / domain ramp (I/Q/D): Follow Choir Doctrine and
`AGENTS.md`; use Problem Documentation First for new platform behavior problems;
preserve authority boundaries; use Codex thread tools for independent
worker/verifier evidence when available; never treat same-context review as an
independent prover; Source Viewer/reader artifacts are the default durable source
surface and Web Lens is explicit live/original inspection. Domain ramp:
docs/checkpoint -> branch tests -> focused local proof -> CI/deploy -> staging
product acceptance.

variant (ranking function) V: 68 total obligations = 9 WIP-preservation + 8
object graph + 7 Qdrant + 8 source-entity + 8 News/Universal Wire + 7
self-development + 7 Nucleus + 6 Choir Base + 8 Autoradio/Pipecat obligations.
Current value: 30. Last Delta V: 0 for documenting the stale deployed frontend
chunk problem after the O4 Universal Wire repair. The latest decreasing move was
Delta V 1 for `5b61fdc4`: sourcecycled now projects graph captures into the
public `universal-wire-platform/platform` VM graph, the active VM returns 12
Universal Wire graph-backed stories, and authenticated Chrome shows Universal
Wire cards with Source Viewer and Web Lens source opening after page reload.

budget: Overnight budget is already partially spent; solvency is feasible only
for bounded O4 follow-through plus explicit open handoff of the broader O5-O8
mission unless the owner grants a new long run.

authority / bounds: Orchestration may create worker/verifier Codex threads,
inspect worktrees, make docs/checkpoint commits, and land reviewed code through
the repo's normal loop. Behavior-changing work must declare mutation class,
protected surfaces, admissible evidence, rollback path, conjecture delta, and
heresy delta before editing. User granted staging deploy authority by pushing to
`origin/main` and authenticated Chrome QA on `choir.news`.

mutation class / protected surfaces: Current move is green documentation for a
discovered deploy/static-asset product problem. A repair would likely be orange
frontend/deployment behavior touching Vite chunk loading, static asset caching or
release retention, and Source Viewer/Web Lens launch reliability. It must not
touch Texture canonical writes, Trace/evidence, candidate computers,
auth/session renewal, vmctl, gateway/provider calls, Qdrant, publication/export,
promotion/rollback, or run acceptance unless separately documented.

evidence packet: Behavior-changing landings require pushed commit SHA, CI run,
deploy status, staging health/build identity, deployed acceptance proof, verifier
thread id/verdict, rollback refs, mutation class, protected surfaces, heresy
delta, conjecture delta, residual risks, and next realism axis. Docs-only moves
require diff hygiene, docs truth workflow after push when pushed, and clear
non-claims.

heresy delta: `discovered` for the stale-client asset problem; `repaired` only
after a tested/deployed fix proves already-open clients either keep working or
fail with an intentional reload/recovery path. Do not count discovery as repair.

position / live conjectures / open edges: O0 preservation, O1 objectgraph, O2
Qdrant derived index, O3 source entity phases, and O4 branch-level graph/source
proofs are recorded in the ledger with worker/verifier thread ids and accepted
commits. The latest staging O4 repair is on `origin/main`: runtime code deploy
identity `5b61fdc4fda5376d1fc39b119f12687944d41427`; docs evidence head
`392c5cb5bacd185db46a9659c664f561f5715d58`. CI run `28259046853` passed and
Node B health reported `5b61fdc4` deployed at `2026-06-26T19:02:50Z`.
Sourcecycled cycle `cycle_31ff8e99fc978df53000a511` wrote 3,833 web captures
through the runtime API into the public platform VM graph. Authenticated Chrome
as `yusefnathanson@me.com` showed 12 Universal Wire articles. `OPEN SOURCE`
opened a Source Viewer reader artifact. The first `WEB LENS` click in an
already-open post-deploy tab failed on stale dynamic import
`/assets/BrowserApp-BACPaCdk.js`; a full page reload cleared the stale chunk and
Web Lens opened `https://t.me/pulsenigeria247/1`. Current problem conjecture:
Choir's deploy/static-asset strategy does not protect already-open SPA clients
from chunk filename turnover across deploys, so source-open actions can fail
until manual reload. Remaining open O4/O5+ edges: stale frontend chunk repair,
native Texture body `source_ref` citation carry-forward, publication/export,
Qdrant projection, provider/search realism, run acceptance, promotion/rollback,
and broader O5-O8 settlement.

next move: inspect frontend/deploy static asset serving and stale dynamic import
handling, then choose the narrowest repair candidate. Preferred discriminator:
prove whether old `/assets/*.js` chunks are deleted or cache headers cause
already-open clients to request unavailable chunks. If repair is nontrivial,
create a worker thread with this paradoc/ledger and require an independent
verifier thread before landing.

ledger file: `docs/mission-overnight-autoradio-platform-checklist-v0.ledger.md`

version / lineage: v0 created after email-freeze landing. It supersedes loose
queue ordering from `docs/worktree-review-2026-06-23.md` for overnight execution
order while preserving that report as evidence.

learning state: Thread-native orchestration is now proved usable in this Codex
environment through `codex_app` thread tools. The current shared learning is that
local/branch graph proofs did not settle O4 until staging auth, deploy identity,
sourcecycled readback, active platform VM API, and authenticated browser product
QA all agreed.

settlement: not settled. The O4 public graph visibility blocker is repaired, but
this mission remains `working` because stale-client deploy behavior and larger
O4/O5-O8 obligations remain open. Exit requires `settled`, `open_handoff`,
`blocked`, or `superseded` with remaining V and next assignment explicit.

## Suggested Goal String

```text
Use Parallax on docs/mission-overnight-autoradio-platform-checklist-v0.md. Treat it as the source program for an overnight, thread-native mission. One orchestration thread owns the checklist, ledger, worker/verifier thread creation, dependency order, worktree hygiene, and evidence synthesis. Current Codex thread tools are available through codex_app after tool discovery: list_projects/create_thread to start bounded project-scoped implementation and verifier threads, send_message_to_thread for follow-ups and explicit callbacks, read_thread/list_threads to reconnect verdicts, handoff_thread/get_handoff_status for ownership-transfer cases, and set_thread_title/set_thread_pinned/set_thread_archived for operator hygiene. If thread tools are not exposed in a later execution environment, record that as a blocker to thread-native settlement and do not treat same-context review as independent proof. Execute in order: O0 preserve WIP, O1 object graph, O2 Qdrant derived index, O3 source entities, O4 News/Universal Wire, O5 Choir-in-Choir self-development, O6 Nucleus capsules, O7 Choir Base, O8 Autoradio/Pipecat vertical slice. Each worker assignment must name mutation class, protected surfaces, admissible evidence, rollback path, heresy delta, callback target, and stop condition. Follow AGENTS.md: Problem Documentation First for new behavior problems; behavior-changing landings require commit, push, CI, deploy identity, staging acceptance, verifier evidence, rollback refs, and residual risks. Update Parallax State in place and append to docs/mission-overnight-autoradio-platform-checklist-v0.ledger.md after each material pass. Exit only as settled, open_handoff, blocked, or superseded, with remaining V and next thread assignment explicit.
```
