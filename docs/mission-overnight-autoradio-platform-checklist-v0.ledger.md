# Overnight Autoradio Platform Checklist v0 Ledger

## 2026-06-26 - Mission Created

Claim: A thread-native orchestration paradoc can turn the current WIP queue into
an overnight checklist whose order is object graph, News, self-development,
Nucleus, Choir Base, then Autoradio/Pipecat.

Move: construct.

Expected Delta V: establish source program and ledger; no checklist obligation
is complete yet.

Actual Delta V: 0 against implementation obligations. The mission control
artifact now exists.

Receipts:

- `docs/mission-overnight-autoradio-platform-checklist-v0.md`
- `docs/mission-overnight-autoradio-platform-checklist-v0.ledger.md`

Open edge: Current tool surface did not expose Codex thread primitives during
authoring. The overnight runner must discover/load them before claiming
thread-native settlement.

## 2026-06-26 - Thread Tool Context Updated

Claim: The authoring-time capability blocker can be narrowed because the
current Codex app surface exposes the thread primitives needed for a
thread-native overnight run.

Move: shift, from missing-tool assumption to discovered Codex app thread
surface.

Expected Delta V: 0 against implementation obligations; reduce observer
uncertainty before O0.

Actual Delta V: 0 against the 67 checklist obligations. The thread-tool edge is
narrowed, not settled by itself.

Receipts:

- `tool_search` exposed Codex app thread tools in this session.
- Available primitives include `list_projects`, `create_thread`,
  `send_message_to_thread`, `read_thread`, `list_threads`, `handoff_thread`,
  `get_handoff_status`, `set_thread_title`, `set_thread_pinned`, and
  `set_thread_archived`.
- `docs/mission-overnight-autoradio-platform-checklist-v0.md`

Open edge: The overnight orchestration thread must still create actual
project-scoped worker and verifier threads, record their ids/callback
instructions, and use their verdicts as evidence before claiming
thread-native settlement.

## 2026-06-26 - O0 Worker And Verifier Threads Created

Claim: O0 can move from thread-tool capability discovery to real thread-native
evidence gathering.

Move: construct bounded thread assignments.

Expected Delta V: 0 against implementation obligations; create the independent
worker/prover substrate needed to decide O0 without same-context review.

Actual Delta V: 0 against the 67 checklist obligations. Thread-native evidence
collection is active, but O0 remains incomplete until the worker report and
verifier verdict are incorporated.

Receipts:

- `list_projects` found project id `/Users/wiz/go-choir`.
- Created O0 worker thread `019f0270-aad3-7001-a6df-d6bc21aec9ab`, titled
  `O0 worker - Autoradio WIP inventory`, pinned.
- Created O0 verifier thread `019f0271-02d9-7391-a564-3ffc2dfce2cd`, titled
  `O0 verifier - Autoradio WIP inventory`, pinned.
- `read_thread` showed both threads active immediately after creation.

Open edge: Orchestration must read the worker report, then the verifier verdict,
before preserving WIP handles or starting O1. The verifier may initially block
until the worker finishes.

## 2026-06-26 - O0 Verifier Blocked On Missing Worker Report

Claim: O0 inventory is not yet verified because the worker has not produced the
required final report.

Move: probe independent verifier thread.

Expected Delta V: 0 against implementation obligations; decide whether O0 has
enough inventory evidence to preserve WIP handles before O1.

Actual Delta V: 0. Verifier verdict was `blocked`, not `accept`; O0 remains
incomplete.

Receipts:

- Verifier thread `019f0271-02d9-7391-a564-3ffc2dfce2cd` completed with
  verdict `blocked`.
- Verifier finding: worker thread `019f0270-aad3-7001-a6df-d6bc21aec9ab` was
  still `inProgress` and had progress updates only, not final sections
  `Findings`, `Evidence Commands`, `Recommended Preservation Handles`,
  `Blockers/Risks`, and `Next O0 Move`.
- Verifier finding: `/Users/wiz/go-choir` dirty state changed during
  verification after orchestration edited this paradoc and ledger, so the
  worker must refresh current dirty status before finalizing.
- Verifier spot checks found no obvious contradiction in partial topology
  claims: `diagnose/email-freeze` and sampled detached Codex heads looked
  superseded by `main`, while the four Cascade branch heads checked were not
  ancestors of `main`.

Open edge: Wait for the worker final report, then re-run verifier review
against that report before preserving WIP handles or starting O1.

## 2026-06-26 - O0 Inventory Verification Accepted

Claim: The refreshed O0 worker report is accurate enough for orchestration to
decide which WIP handles to preserve before O1.

Move: probe independent verifier thread after worker refresh.

Expected Delta V: 0 against implementation obligations; convert the verifier
state from `blocked` to a decision.

Actual Delta V: 0. Verifier verdict is `accept`; inventory is accepted, but O0
is not complete until preservation handles are created or precise blockers are
recorded.

Receipts:

- Worker thread `019f0270-aad3-7001-a6df-d6bc21aec9ab` completed a refreshed
  final report.
- Verifier thread `019f0271-02d9-7391-a564-3ffc2dfce2cd` re-ran read-only
  checks and returned verdict `accept`.
- Verifier checked worker report, root SHA/dirty status, worktree inventory,
  stash list, per-worktree status/divergence, branch ancestry, and email-freeze
  merge reference.
- Accepted next preservation targets: main mission docs, source-entity docs,
  Universal Wire docs, objectgraph prototype, Qdrant prototype, PPTX
  learning/docs, and docs-checker cleanup.

Open edge: Create explicit preservation branches/commits for the accepted dirty
worktrees before starting O1.

## 2026-06-26 - O0 WIP Preservation Handles Created

Claim: The accepted WIP inventory has durable recovery handles, so O0 can close
after the orchestration paradoc/ledger update is preserved.

Move: construct preservation branches/commits.

Expected Delta V: 9, one for each O0 checklist obligation.

Actual Delta V: 9. Variant total corrected from 67 to 68 because O0 has nine
checklist bullets; current V is 59.

Receipts:

- Universal Wire diagnosis:
  `preserve/o0-universal-wire-diagnosis-2026-06-26` at `a246ab04`.
- Source-entity migration:
  `preserve/o0-source-entity-migration-2026-06-26` at `7a355806`.
- Objectgraph prototype:
  `preserve/o0-objectgraph-prototype-2026-06-26` at `b6b45b60`.
- Qdrant prototype:
  `preserve/o0-qdrant-prototype-2026-06-26` at `4c1b28be`.
- PPTX learning/prototype:
  `preserve/o0-pptx-learning-2026-06-26` at `4a687522`.
- Docs-checker cleanup:
  `preserve/o0-docs-checker-cleanup-2026-06-26` at `238c7ce2`.
- No stashes existed during the accepted worker/verifier inventory.
- Email-freeze worktrees were accepted as superseded by `main` via verifier
  ancestry checks and email-freeze merge reference.

Open edge: Preserve this orchestration paradoc and ledger on
`preserve/o0-autoradio-mission-state-2026-06-26`, then start O1 with a bounded
objectgraph worker/verifier thread pair.

## 2026-06-26 - O0 Closed

Claim: O0 WIP preservation is complete enough to start O1.

Move: settle O0.

Expected Delta V: 0 additional; this records the final preservation handle for
the already-counted O0 descent.

Actual Delta V: 0. Current V remains 59.

Receipts:

- Orchestration mission-state branch:
  `preserve/o0-autoradio-mission-state-2026-06-26`.
- All accepted dirty WIP clusters now have explicit preservation branch/commit
  handles.
- Accepted inventory verifier verdict: `accept`.

Open edge: O1 must begin from the objectgraph prototype preservation handle and
decide whether to land a branch-level `internal/objectgraph`, a narrower
package, or a design-only successor. No O1 implementation is accepted yet.

## 2026-06-26 - O1 Worker And Verifier Threads Created

Claim: O1 can begin as a bounded objectgraph worker/prover pair using the
preserved mission state and objectgraph prototype handle.

Move: construct bounded O1 thread assignments.

Expected Delta V: 0; create the worker/prover substrate for O1 without claiming
objectgraph progress.

Actual Delta V: 0. Current V remains 59.

Receipts:

- O1 worker thread `019f0279-b855-7e52-b830-70a8eb4bbfe8`, titled
  `O1 worker - Object Graph Foundation`, pinned.
- O1 worker cwd from thread listing:
  `/Users/wiz/.codex/worktrees/3026/go-choir`.
- O1 verifier thread `019f027a-3434-7ef2-b813-f3f21213167f`, titled
  `O1 verifier - Object Graph Foundation`, pinned.
- Worker authority: own Codex worktree only; protected surfaces are object
  identity, content hashing, edge storage, persistence behavior, and package
  API shape.
- Verifier authority: read-only review of worker report/diff/tests.

Open edge: Read the O1 worker report, then incorporate verifier verdict before
marking any O1 checklist item complete.

## 2026-06-26 - O1 Verifier Blocked Pending Worker Report

Claim: O1 cannot be evaluated until the objectgraph worker produces a completed
report and diff.

Move: probe independent verifier thread.

Expected Delta V: 0; decide whether O1 has evidence ready for review.

Actual Delta V: 0. Verifier verdict was `blocked`.

Receipts:

- O1 verifier thread `019f027a-3434-7ef2-b813-f3f21213167f` returned
  verdict `blocked`.
- Verifier finding: O1 worker thread `019f0279-b855-7e52-b830-70a8eb4bbfe8`
  was still `inProgress`.
- Verifier finding: worker cwd `/Users/wiz/.codex/worktrees/3026/go-choir`
  had no finished diff at verification time.

Open edge: Wait for the O1 worker report, then re-run verifier against the
completed worker branch/diff/tests.

## 2026-06-26 - O1 Objectgraph Foundation Accepted

Claim: A branch-level objectgraph foundation now exists with independent
verifier acceptance.

Move: settle O1 at branch level.

Expected Delta V: 8, one for each O1 checklist obligation.

Actual Delta V: 8. Current V is 51.

Receipts:

- O1 worker thread `019f0279-b855-7e52-b830-70a8eb4bbfe8` completed with
  branch `codex/o1-objectgraph-foundation`.
- Worker commits: `fa06b718` docs checkpoint and `34ece272` objectgraph
  implementation.
- Implementation cherry-picked into this mission branch as `a68bc801`.
- O1 verifier thread `019f027a-3434-7ef2-b813-f3f21213167f` returned verdict
  `accept` with no blocking findings.
- Verifier checked deterministic object IDs/content hashes, deterministic edge
  IDs, memory and SQLite stores, SQLite reopen persistence proof, required
  object kinds, and paradoc/ledger updates.
- Worker and verifier both ran `nix develop -c go test ./internal/objectgraph`;
  orchestration re-ran the same focused test after cherry-pick and it passed.

Evidence boundary: This is branch-level/local objectgraph proof only. It does
not claim main, CI, deploy, staging, Texture, Universal Wire, Qdrant runtime,
Dolt, auth, vmctl, provider, promotion, rollback, or production behavior.

Residual risk: `choir.autoradio_run_sheet` is registered as versioned, but
version-chain behavior is not implemented yet. That is accepted as outside O1's
foundation scope.

Open edge: O2 should begin with Qdrant as a rebuildable derived index over
objectgraph data, using the branch-level objectgraph API and preserving
source-of-truth boundaries.

## 2026-06-26 - O2 Worker And Verifier Threads Created

Claim: O2 can begin as a bounded Qdrant derived-index worker/prover pair using
the accepted objectgraph foundation and preserved Qdrant prototype handle.

Move: construct bounded O2 thread assignments.

Expected Delta V: 0; create the worker/prover substrate for O2 without claiming
Qdrant progress.

Actual Delta V: 0. Current V remains 51.

Receipts:

- O2 worker thread `019f0285-037b-7a21-b352-ece5b84efeca`, titled
  `O2 worker - Qdrant Derived Index`, pinned.
- O2 worker cwd from thread listing:
  `/Users/wiz/.codex/worktrees/fb93/go-choir`.
- O2 verifier thread `019f0285-e660-7cd1-a468-554e9b175825`, titled
  `O2 verifier - Qdrant Derived Index`, pinned.
- Worker authority: own Codex worktree only; protected surfaces are
  objectgraph source-of-truth boundaries, derived-index rebuildability,
  collection naming/alias switch, embedder/provider boundary, local Qdrant
  config, and rollback/rebuild path.
- Verifier authority: read-only review of worker report/diff/tests.

Open edge: Read the O2 worker report, then incorporate verifier verdict before
marking any O2 checklist item complete.

## 2026-06-26 - O2 Verifier Blocked Pending Worker Report

Claim: O2 cannot be evaluated until the Qdrant worker produces a completed
report and diff.

Move: probe independent verifier thread.

Expected Delta V: 0; decide whether O2 has evidence ready for review.

Actual Delta V: 0. Verifier verdict was `blocked`.

Receipts:

- O2 verifier thread `019f0285-e660-7cd1-a468-554e9b175825` returned verdict
  `blocked`.
- Verifier finding: O2 worker thread `019f0285-037b-7a21-b352-ece5b84efeca`
  was still `inProgress`.
- Verifier finding: worker cwd `/Users/wiz/.codex/worktrees/fb93/go-choir` was
  on `codex/o2-qdrant-derived-index`, but had no O2 implementation commit or
  final report at verification time.

Open edge: Wait for the O2 worker final report with branch/commit handles,
tests run, local Qdrant status or blocker, alias-switch decision,
objectgraph-input boundary, embedder/provider boundary, and rebuild/rollback
documentation. Then re-run verifier against the actual diff and evidence.

## 2026-06-26 - O2 Prototype Review And Documentation Checkpoint

Claim: O2 can reuse the preserved Qdrant prototype only after correcting its
alias-switch shape and replacing sample-only objects with objectgraph-backed
inputs.

Move: probe plus documentation checkpoint before orange implementation.

Expected Delta V: 1 for reviewing the Qdrant prototype alias-switch
correctness, with implementation obligations still open.

Actual Delta V: 1. Current V is 50.

Receipts:

- O2 worker branch: `codex/o2-qdrant-derived-index` in
  `/Users/wiz/.codex/worktrees/fb93/go-choir`.
- Preserved Qdrant prototype reviewed at
  `preserve/o0-qdrant-prototype-2026-06-26` (`4c1b28be`) from
  `/Users/wiz/.windsurf/worktrees/go-choir/go-choir-87c664e7`.
- Prototype finding: alias switch used an `update_alias` action shape. O2 will
  implement switch/rollback with one Qdrant alias transaction containing
  `delete_alias` for the old mapping plus `create_alias` for the new mapping.
- `docs/paradoc-qdrant-indexing-pipeline.md` now records the narrowed O2
  source-of-truth, embedder-boundary, rebuild, and rollback path.

Evidence boundary: branch-level docs checkpoint only. No Qdrant runtime,
provider, staging, or product claim.

Open edge: Implement `internal/qdrant` as a derived index over
`internal/objectgraph.Object`, keep deterministic embedding test-only, and
probe local Qdrant availability before final worker report.

## 2026-06-26 - O2 Derived Index Implementation

Claim: The O2 branch now contains a minimal Qdrant derived-index package over
objectgraph data, but O2 remains incomplete until independent verifier review
and real-Qdrant verification when a local service is available.

Move: construct bounded package implementation and focused tests.

Expected Delta V: 4 for replacing sample objects with objectgraph-backed
inputs, keeping deterministic embedding test-only, defining the production
embedder boundary, and documenting rebuild/rollback.

Actual Delta V: 4. Current V is 46.

Receipts:

- Added `internal/qdrant` package with Qdrant REST client, payload schema,
  safe collection/alias naming, deterministic point IDs derived from canonical
  IDs, objectgraph projection, shadow-collection build/switch flow, rollback,
  and old-collection cleanup.
- Added `docker-compose.qdrant.yml` as local Qdrant service config.
- Hermetic tests construct objectgraph objects through `internal/objectgraph`
  and verify payload identity refs, delete/create alias switch actions,
  shadow cleanup before alias mutation on verification failure, and test-only
  deterministic embedding.
- Local-Qdrant probe: `curl -fsS http://localhost:6333/healthz` failed with
  connection refused. `nix develop -c go test -v ./internal/qdrant -run
  TestLocalQdrantBuildAndSwitchIfAvailable` skipped with `dial tcp
  127.0.0.1:6333: connect: connection refused`.
- Focused test receipt: `nix develop -c go test ./internal/qdrant` passed.

Evidence boundary: branch-level package tests only. No live Qdrant, provider,
gateway, runtime route, staging, product, or promotion claim.

Open edge: Commit the implementation, run touched package tests, and send the
branch to an independent verifier focused on schema, alias switch, and
source-of-truth boundaries. A future local-Qdrant proof should start the local
service and rerun the integration test.

## 2026-06-26 - O2 Branch-Level Verifier Accepted

Claim: The Qdrant derived-index implementation is coherent enough to continue
at branch level, but O2 remains incomplete until the real local-Qdrant proof
passes.

Move: re-run the independent O2 verifier against the worker's completed branch.

Expected Delta V: 1 for opening and completing the verifier thread focused on
schema, alias switch, and source-of-truth boundaries.

Actual Delta V: 1. Current V is 45.

Receipts:

- O2 worker thread `019f0285-037b-7a21-b352-ece5b84efeca` completed on branch
  `codex/o2-qdrant-derived-index` with docs checkpoint `7bc94611` and
  implementation commit `d90d8a84`.
- O2 verifier thread `019f0285-e660-7cd1-a468-554e9b175825` returned verdict
  `accept` after inspecting the completed worker branch.
- Verifier checked alias switch/rollback through one `UpdateAliases` call with
  `delete_alias` then `create_alias`, objectgraph-backed projection,
  test-only deterministic embedding, production embedder/model metadata
  boundary, and documented rebuild/rollback semantics.
- Verifier reran `nix develop -c go test ./internal/qdrant`,
  `nix develop -c go test -count=1 ./internal/qdrant`, and
  `nix develop -c go test ./internal/objectgraph ./internal/qdrant`; all
  passed.
- Verifier reran
  `nix develop -c go test -v ./internal/qdrant -run TestLocalQdrantBuildAndSwitchIfAvailable`;
  it skipped with `127.0.0.1:6333` connection refused.

Evidence boundary: branch-level code/test/verifier acceptance only. No live
Qdrant, main, CI, deploy, staging, provider, gateway, runtime route, product,
promotion, or rollback claim.

Open edge: Start a safe local Qdrant service from `docker-compose.qdrant.yml`
or equivalent and rerun the integration test. O2 is not complete until that
live build/switch/rollback proof passes and is recorded.

## 2026-06-26 - O2 Incorporated Into Orchestration Branch

Claim: The independently accepted O2 branch-level implementation is now present
on the orchestration mission branch with root-branch focused test receipts.

Move: incorporate worker commits and resolve mission evidence against the newer
orchestration branch state.

Expected Delta V: 0; this records incorporation and root receipts after the
verifier acceptance already counted the relevant O2 obligation.

Actual Delta V: 0. Current V remains 45.

Receipts:

- O2 worker docs checkpoint `7bc94611` was incorporated as root commit
  `dae88f60`.
- O2 worker implementation `d90d8a84` was incorporated as root commit
  `b02d43d5`.
- Root orchestration branch test:
  `nix develop -c go test ./internal/objectgraph ./internal/qdrant` passed.
- Root orchestration branch live-Qdrant probe:
  `nix develop -c go test -v ./internal/qdrant -run TestLocalQdrantBuildAndSwitchIfAvailable`
  skipped because `http://localhost:6333/healthz` returned
  `dial tcp 127.0.0.1:6333: connect: connection refused`.

Evidence boundary: local branch-level test receipt only. No live Qdrant,
main, CI, deploy, staging, provider, gateway, runtime route, product,
promotion, or rollback claim.

Open edge: O2 has one remaining obligation: start a safe local Qdrant service
and pass the live build/switch/rollback integration test before marking O2
complete or proceeding to O3.

## 2026-06-26 - O2 Live Local Qdrant Proof Passed

Claim: The Qdrant derived-index package can build, switch, and roll back
against a real local Qdrant instance.

Move: start a disposable local Qdrant service through Nix and rerun the live
integration proof uncached.

Expected Delta V: 1 for the remaining O2 live local-Qdrant obligation.

Actual Delta V: 1. Current V is 44.

Receipts:

- Docker Desktop was initially unavailable; `open -a Docker` started the daemon,
  but Docker image acquisition for `qdrant/qdrant:latest` and
  `qdrant/qdrant:v1.13.6` hung without creating an image. This did not block
  the proof because Nix provided Qdrant directly.
- `nix shell nixpkgs#qdrant -c qdrant --version` returned `qdrant 1.18.1`.
- Started Qdrant `1.18.1` with telemetry disabled and storage under
  `/tmp/choir-qdrant-o2-proof`, outside the repo:
  `QDRANT__STORAGE__STORAGE_PATH=/tmp/choir-qdrant-o2-proof QDRANT__SERVICE__HTTP_PORT=6333 QDRANT__SERVICE__GRPC_PORT=6334 nix shell nixpkgs#qdrant -c qdrant --disable-telemetry`.
- `curl -fsS http://localhost:6333/healthz` returned `healthz check passed`.
- `nix develop -c go test -count=1 -v ./internal/qdrant -run TestLocalQdrantBuildAndSwitchIfAvailable`
  passed.
- `nix develop -c go test -count=1 ./internal/objectgraph ./internal/qdrant`
  passed.

Evidence boundary: local Qdrant service proof only. No main, CI, deploy,
staging, provider, gateway, runtime route, product, promotion, or rollback
claim.

Open edge: Request independent verifier readback over this O2 completion
evidence before launching O3.

## 2026-06-26 - O2 Completion Verifier Accepted

Claim: O2 can be treated as branch-level complete.

Move: independent verifier readback over the live local-Qdrant evidence and
mission-state update.

Expected Delta V: 0; the live-proof obligation was already counted, and this
entry records the independent readback needed before launching O3.

Actual Delta V: 0. Current V remains 44.

Receipts:

- O2 verifier thread `019f0285-e660-7cd1-a468-554e9b175825` returned verdict
  `accept` for the final O2 completion readback.
- Verifier confirmed the mission doc and ledger scope the claim to local
  branch-level proof and explicitly exclude main, CI, deploy, staging,
  provider, gateway, runtime route, product, promotion, and rollback claims.
- Verifier reran
  `nix develop -c go test -count=1 -v ./internal/qdrant -run TestLocalQdrantBuildAndSwitchIfAvailable`
  and `nix develop -c go test -count=1 ./internal/objectgraph ./internal/qdrant`;
  both passed.
- Verifier confirmed the running service was Nix Qdrant `1.18.1`, listening on
  `6333/6334`, with `QDRANT__STORAGE__STORAGE_PATH=/tmp/choir-qdrant-o2-proof`.
- Verifier checked that Qdrant had no leftover collections or aliases after
  the tests.

Evidence boundary: branch-level O2 completion only. No main, CI, deploy,
staging, provider, gateway, runtime route, product, promotion, or rollback
claim.

Open edge: Launch O3 source entities with a bounded worker/verifier pair.

## 2026-06-26 - O3 Source Entity Design Review Launched

Claim: O3 should begin with independent review of the existing source-entity
migration design before any implementation touches protected source/Texture
surfaces.

Move: create a read-only O3 design-review thread.

Expected Delta V: 0; this starts the O3 review gate but does not complete the
O3 independent-review obligation until a verdict exists.

Actual Delta V: 0. Current V remains 44.

Receipts:

- O3 reviewer thread `019f02a7-11d9-7573-885c-d91b7cffe8be` created, titled
  `O3 reviewer - Source Entity Migration design`, and pinned.
- Reviewer prompt is read-only and asks it to compare the root
  `docs/paradoc-source-entity-migration.md` with preserved O0 source-entity
  migration commit `7a355806` in
  `/Users/wiz/.codex/worktrees/2bae/go-choir`.
- Protected surfaces named for review: Texture canonical writes, source entity
  identity, `source_ref` edges, tri-state citation, citation carry-forward,
  persisted-revision compatibility, News/Texture/Autoradio shared source
  substrate, and objectgraph source-of-truth boundaries.

Evidence boundary: thread launch only. No source-entity design acceptance,
implementation, runtime, staging, product, or landing claim.

Open edge: Read the O3 reviewer verdict and incorporate it before launching
any O3 implementation worker.
