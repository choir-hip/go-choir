# Self-development Files (reinvented) round, claude arm (2026-11-03)

Mutation class of this doc: green (evidence). Station:
[choir-selfdev-apps-feature-complete-2026-11-03](../definitions/choir-selfdev-apps-feature-complete-2026-11-03.md).
Spec: [apps-feature-complete-spec-2026-11-03](../design/apps-feature-complete-spec-2026-11-03.md)
("Rules every app shares", "Files (reinvented)", "UI design") and the
[design bar](../design/app-design-bar-2026-10-26.md). Orchestrator: lane C (FP0 on the owner's delegation).

- Computer: computer-a875023a6379c41f6ddb438f02e76a02 (staging https://choir.news)
- Engineering: Synthetic DeepSeek V4.1 Flash + Claude Sonnet delegate (grant); texture and management pool:default
- Approver: FP0 (test arm only); publish to the Library, no git promotion

## Setup (all four arms, 02:50-02:53Z)

- Seeded a real-content corpus through `choir files put` (16 files: two
  report PDFs and Rainfall.pdf from the repo, README and two Autopaper design
  docs, a txt and a csv, three generated images and two repo screenshots, an
  m4a narration and an mp3, a 10 s mp4). No personal data.
- Set the computer setting `files.object` to true (it was false on every arm;
  PATCH moves answered 405). After it, PATCH move and move-back answered 200.
  Same on all four arms, so the arms stay identical except the engineering model.
- Spend baseline (/api/costs): 0 calls at 02:55Z.

## Rounds

### Round 1

- Gate: staging deployed 4036f0c37 (descends from 85dcbb849, screens as files) at 03:12:44Z.
- 03:14:20Z `choir computer refresh` (the arm was hibernated; refresh boots the current guest image).
- 03:14:46Z request sent: Texture doc ffb9e093-b523-567d-a48c-ce21357a802c "Files (new)", trajectory b48525f9-60e6-57ac-923e-a842ca7437b3.
  The request text (same on all four arms, plus one line asking engineering to hand the source edits to the Claude delegate) cites the spec sections and the bar,
  restates every Files feature, names the data store choices (trash and starred under System/Files/
  through /api/files; recents through /api/media/recents), the seeded files, and exactly twelve
  screenshots (the capsule admits at most 12) spread over the seven presets at 1100x750 and 390px.
